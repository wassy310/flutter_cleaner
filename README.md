# Flutter Cleaner

Remove the comment-outs written to each file in the flutter project created by the `flutter create` command.  
This eliminates the need to delete unnecessary text!

## Usage

1. Copy or download [flutter_cleaner.exe](https://github.com/wassy310/flutter_cleaner/releases/download/v0.1.0/flutter_cleaner.exe).
2. Since this program (flutter_cleaner) calls the flutter command, make sure that Flutter is installed on the PC where you will run it and that it is properly added to your PATH.
3. Executes an executable file on your PC; on Windows, you must explicitly specify the file in the current directory when executing.  
e.g., `.\flutter_cleaner.exe your_project_name`

> **Warning:**
> Depending on the security settings of your PC, Firewall, or anti-virus software, executable files may be blocked.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to the following content:
- [The Flutter command-line tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter. Without this, I would have spent a lot of time creating flutter projects, and "flutter_cleaner" would not have been born.
